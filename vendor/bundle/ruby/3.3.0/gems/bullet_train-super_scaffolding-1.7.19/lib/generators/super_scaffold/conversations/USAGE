Description:
  Generate files needed to add conversations to a model.

Example:
  E.g. Add conversations to Posts from a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:conversations Post Team

  This will create:
    db/migrate/20240716162627_add_project_to_conversations.rb
  And update:
    app/models/ability.rb
    app/models/conversation.rb
    app/models/project.rb
    app/views/account/projects/show.html.erb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
