Description:
  Generate an action to export a list of model records.

Example:
  E.g. Generate an Export action that exports many Posts from a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:action_models:performs_export Export Post Team

  This will create:
    app/avo/resources/posts_export_action.rb
    app/controllers/account/posts/
    app/controllers/avo/posts_export_actions_controller.rb
    app/models/posts.rb
    app/models/posts/
    app/views/account/posts/export_actions/
    config/locales/en/posts/
    db/migrate/20240612185709_create_posts_export_actions.rb
    test/factories/posts/
    test/models/posts/
  And update:
    app/models/team.rb
    app/views/account/posts/_index.html.erb
    config/models/roles.yml
    config/routes.rb
    config/routes/api/v1.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
