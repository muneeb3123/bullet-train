Description:
  Generate an action that processes a model of choice for its parent.

Example:
  E.g. Generate a CSV Importer that creates many Listings on a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:action_models:targets_one_parent CsvImport Listing Team

  This will create:
    app/avo/resources/listings_csv_import_action.rb
    app/controllers/account/listings/
    app/controllers/api/v1/listings/
    app/controllers/avo/listings_csv_import_actions_controller.rb
    app/models/listings.rb
    app/models/listings/
    app/views/account/listings/csv_import_actions/
    app/views/api/v1/listings/csv_import_actions/
    config/locales/en/listings/
    db/migrate/20240109100805_create_listings_csv_import_actions.rb
    test/controllers/api/v1/listings/
    test/factories/listings/
    test/models/listings/
  And update:
    app/models/team.rb
    app/views/account/listings/_index.html.erb
    config/models/roles.yml
    config/routes.rb
    config/routes/api/v1.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
