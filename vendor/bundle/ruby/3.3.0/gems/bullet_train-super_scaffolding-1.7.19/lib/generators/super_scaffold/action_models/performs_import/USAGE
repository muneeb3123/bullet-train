Description:
  Generate an action that imports a list of records to its parent.

Example:
  E.g. Generate a CSV Importer that creates many Posts on a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:action_models:performs_import CsvImport Post Team

  This will create:
    app/avo/resources/posts_import_action.rb
    app/controllers/account/posts/import_actions_controller.rb
    app/controllers/avo/posts_import_actions_controller.rb
    app/models/posts/import_action.rb
    app/views/account/posts/import_actions/
    config/locales/en/posts/import_actions.en.yml
    db/migrate/20240612185843_create_posts_import_actions.rb
    test/factories/posts/import_actions.rb
    test/models/posts/import_action_test.rb
  And update:
    app/models/team.rb
    app/views/account/posts/_index.html.erb
    config/models/roles.yml
    config/routes.rb
    config/routes/api/v1.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
