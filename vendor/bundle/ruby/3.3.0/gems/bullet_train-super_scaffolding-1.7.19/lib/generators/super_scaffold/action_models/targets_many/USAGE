Description:
  Generate an action that targets many models.

Example:
  E.g. Perform an Archive action that targets many Projects on a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:action_models:targets_many Archive Project Team

  This will create:
    app/avo/resources/projects_archive_action.rb
    app/controllers/account/projects/
    app/controllers/api/v1/projects/
    app/controllers/avo/projects_archive_actions_controller.rb
    app/models/projects.rb
    app/models/projects/
    app/views/account/projects/archive_actions/
    app/views/api/v1/projects/archive_actions/
    config/locales/en/projects/
    db/migrate/20240109055956_create_projects_archive_actions.rb
    test/controllers/api/v1/projects/
    test/factories/projects/
    test/models/projects/
  And update:
    app/models/team.rb
    app/views/account/projects/_index.html.erb
    config/models/roles.yml
    config/routes.rb
    config/routes/api/v1.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
