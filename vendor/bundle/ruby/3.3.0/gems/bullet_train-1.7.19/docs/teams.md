# Teams

Please read the article providing [an overview of organizational teams in Bullet Train](https://blog.bullettrain.co/teams-should-be-an-mvp-feature/). This article doesn't just explain how `Team`, `Membership`, `Invitation` and `Role` relate and function in Bullet Train, but it also explains how to properly think about resource ownership even in complex scenarios. Furthermore, it touches on ways in which Bullet Train's organizational structure has been successfully extended in more complicated systems.

Rather than simply duplicating the content of that blog article here, we'll focus on keeping that article up-to-date so it can benefit not only incoming Bullet Train developers, but also the broader developer ecosystem.
