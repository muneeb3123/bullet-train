      This is a placeholder view. It serves no purpose by default in Bullet Train,
      but it allows you to use Super Scaffolding for models that fall under a <code>User</code>
      instead of a <code>Team</code>. In our experience these types of models are quite
      rare, so please use this sparingly, but if you're using this, you've probably
      chatted with us about it.
